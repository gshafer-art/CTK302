<p> This is Mushy! He is a sentient mushroom that controls the forest.<br>
  He got his powers from a wish granting fairy who enchanted him and the forest.</br>
  Right now he isn't using his powers because he is very bored.</p>
  <p> Do you want to befriend Mushy? </p>
  <p> Tap him on the head to help the forest grow!</p>
